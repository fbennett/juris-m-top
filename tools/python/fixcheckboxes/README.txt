With the hyperref package, 
pdflatex and xelatex support PDF forms.
Unfortunately, checkboxes do not appear checked when clicked [0].
It seems, this is due to the latex PDF output not containing the "appearance dictionary".

Checkboxes in PDF forms produced by LibreOffice Writer work fine.
fixcheckboxes.py uses python3-pdfrw 0.3 [1] to copy the appearance dictionary from a working checkbox into every checkbox found in the PDF generated by latex.

The result is reportedly working in these applications:
* evince 3.18.2
* PDF-Viewer in Google Chrome 58.0.3029.110
* Adobe Acrobat Reader DC 2017.009.20044
