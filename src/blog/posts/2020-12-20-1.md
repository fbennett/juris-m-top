## Jurisdiction identifiers

There is an important difference between the general principles of
citation in any comprehensive style guide, and the rules of citation
for legal materials.  The former describe patterns of citation
to be applied to all materials of a particular type. The patterns
themselves may vary. Consider how a journal article would appear in
a bibliography formatted in three common styles:

* **Chicago (note style)**<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gilmore, Grant. “Law, Logic and Experience.”
  *Howard Law Journal* 3 (1957): 26–41.

* **APA**<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gilmore, G. (1957). Law, Logic and Experience. *Howard
  Law Journal*, 3, 26–41.

* **Bluebook**<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grant Gilmore, Law, Logic and Experience, 3 <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Howard L.J.</span> 26 (1957).

In contrast, legal citations for a given jurisdiction will be roughly uniform
across all "parent" styles, but there is variation *among
jurisdictions*. For example, consider the following citations to court
judgments, all of which would be correct in any of the three styles above:

* **United States (Supreme
  Court)**<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;International Shoe
  Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310 (1945).

* **United Kingdom (House of
  Lords)**<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donoghue v. Stevenson, [1932]
  A.C. 562 (HL).

* **Germany (*Bundesgerichtshof*)**<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BGH IV ZR 241/18.

To cope with the confluence of format-by-style and
format-by-jurisdiction requirements, the "JM" styles in Jurism render
legal items by first calling a jurisdiction-specific style module to
obtain a set of "building-block" citation elements, and then
assembling them with markup and punctuation appropriate to the parent
style.[^1] In broad outline, the workflow looks like this:

[^1]: Final composition in the parent style gives it control over some
      style-specific features, such as the inclusion or stripping of periods,
      italicization of some titles, back-referencing conventions, and
      a few other details.


``` yaml
type: embedWideImage
src: ./2020-12-20-1/workflow.png
```

This scheme is made possible by a **Jurisdiction** field set on each
legal item. Jurism uses a machine-readable identifier set in this
field (discussed below) to select a *style module* appropriate to the
item.

>> One critical role of the LRR is to supply these essential jurisdiction identifiers,
>> and a human-readable name for each.


## Court abbreviations

In citations to U.S. law, court abbreviations come in two flavors. One
is the form used to indicate the court when citing to a
multi-jurisdictional reporter. The abbreviated name in this case is an
amalgam that to the educated eye expresses both the court and its
jurisdiction:

* Lafond v. Sweeney, 343 P.3d 939 (<span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">Colo.</span> 2015).
* Begley v. Ireson, 399 P.3d 777 (<span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">Colo. Ct. App.</span> 2017).
* Pielet v. Pielet, 978 N.E.2d 1000 (<span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">Ill.</span> 2012).
* McCarthy v. Pointer, 3 N.E.3d 852 (<span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">Ill. App. Ct.</span> 2014).
* Fallini v. Hodel, 725 F. Supp. 1113 (<span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">D. Nev.</span> 1989).
* In Re Moore, 290 B.R. 287 (<span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">Bankr. E.D.N.C.</span> 2003).
* Edwards v. Ayers, 542 F.3d 759 (<span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">9th Cir.</span> 2008).

The second possible form is that used in a dozen or so
U.S. jurisdictions to indicate the court in a "vendor-neutral"
citation form:

* Lafond v. Sweeney, 2015 <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">CO</span> 3.
* Begley v. Ireson, 2017 <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">COA</span> 3.
* Pielet v. Pielet, 2012 <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">IL</span> 112064.
* McCarthy v. Pointer, 2013 <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">IL App (1st)</span> 121688.

To generate these various abbreviations, Jurism sets a
machine-readable code in the **Court** field, which is used together
with the jurisdiction code to look up the correct abbreviation for a
given citation.

>> A second critical role of the LRR is to supply a label and a
>> machine-readable identifier for each court type and, for each
>> jurisdiction having a court of that type, to provide up to two
>> abbreviations for it in that context.

## Reporters and abbreviations

To keep citations compact and clear, citation styles call for
abbreviations to be partially or completely suppressed in some
contexts, to avoid repetition. If a reporter is entirely dedicated
to decisions of a particular court, the court abbreviation is
omitted entirely in the parenthetical below:

* Gedra v. Dallmer Co., 153 Ohio St. 258 (1950).

If a reporter covers decisions of multiple courts in a parent
jurisdiction, the court type is indicated, but specific reference to
the parent jurisdiction is omitted:

* Kashian v. Harriman, 120 Cal. Rptr. 2d 576 (Ct. App. 2002).

In one unusual case (Ohio), the core portion of a vendor-neutral
citation form conveys only the state-level jurisdiction. In this case
as well, reference to the parent jurisdiction is omitted:

* Lanzer v. Louisville, 2016-Ohio-8071 (11th Dist.).

Finally, it can happen that certain reporters, because of their
form of publication, require a distinctive citation format.
For example, compare the following two formats for citations
to a decision of the German Federal Administrative Court:

**Ordinary citation**

* BVerwG, NVwZ 1999, 296

|||
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| BVerwG | Court name (*Bundesverwaltungsgericht*)               |
| NVwZ   | Journal name (*Neue Zeitschrift für Verwaltungsrecht* |
| 1999   | Year of report                                        |
| 296    | Page                                                  |


<br/>

**Specially formatted citation**

* BVerwG, Beschl. v. 9.1.1999 – Buchholz 310 § 65 VwGO Nr. 131, S. 2.

|||
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| BVerwG      | Court name (*Bundesverwaltungsgericht*)                                                                |
| Beschl.     | Disposition type (*Beschluss* = judgment)                                                              |

## Identifier formats

The structure of Jurism jurisdiction and court identifiers loosely
follows one portion of the draft URN:LEX specification submitted to
the IETF by Spinosa, Francesconi, and Lupo.[^2] An instance of a court
or other body is identified by two elements: a "jurisdiction;" and a
"court." When the two are combined for processing, they are joined with
a semicolon:

* `<jurisdiction identifier>`  **;**  `<court identifier>`

**Jurisdiction identifiers** (more accurately "domain identifiers")
consist of one or more elements, each composed of lowercase roman
letters and periods, joined by a colon delimiter (no other characters
are permitted). An identifier with two or more elements expresses a
nested set of domains, with the leftmost being the largest and the
rightmost the smallest. The relationship between parent and child
domains is otherwise indeterminate. It may be one of procedural
hierarchy …

| ||
| ---: | ----------------- |
| `us` | United States \| US |
| `us:c9` | US \| Ninth Federal Appellate Circuit |
| `us:c9:ca.cd` | US \| Ninth Federal Appellate Circuit \| Central District of California |

… or a child domain may simply be a container of convenience to group
together courts and other entities that are under the parent's
jurisdiction …

| ||
| ---: | ----------------- |
| `us` | United States \| US |
| `us:fed` | US \| Various federal courts and tribunals |

**Court identifiers** represent a court of a particular *type*, such
as "District Court" or "Court of Appeals," which may be associated
with multiple jurisdictions. The identifier is composed of roman
characters and periods. There are no particular rules for composition
of the court identifier, other than that it must be unique to a given
body within a given top-level domain. For example:

| ||
| ---: | ----------------- |
| `sc` | Supreme Court |
| `district.court` | District Court |

Where a court has divisions that are included in citations, the
court identifier can be extended by an additional element separated
by a tilde (`~`):


| ||
| ---: | ----------------- |
| `ecj~chamber.1` | European Court of Justice, First Chamber |
| `cass~civ.1` | Cour de cassassion 1<sup>re</sup> chambre civil |

>> The primary purpose of the LRR is to support the organization and
>> citation of materials. A jurisdiction identifier is not intended as
>> a firm statement about procedure or institutional structure.
>> Extended identifiers for court divisions are included only if
>> relevant to citation requirements.

      Uniform Resource Name (URN) Namespace for Source of Law
      (LEX)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-spinosa-urn-lex/)”
      (IETF, expired work in progress, inactive, December 8, 2018).

## LRR source files

The Legal Resource Registry supports two specific features of a larger
system: the orderly selection of jurisdictions and courts in the
Jurism user interface; and the correct application of abbreviations in
automatically generated citations. The first is readily apparent when
the down-arrow is pressed or text is typed into the **Jurisdiction**
and **Court** fields of the Jurism client:

``` yaml
type: embedWideImage
src: ./2020-12-20-1/screenshot-jurisdiction-court.png
```

The second role of the LRR is to supply court-in-context abbreviations
for legal citations in the various forms illustrated under [Court
abbreviations](#court-abbreviations) above.

#### Filename

Each top-level jurisdiction supported by Jurism is represented by a
single source file, named for the *domain* that it covers. Domains are
either the two-character ISO code of a country, or a string (composed
of roman letters and periods) identifying an international
organization.

* **juris-**`<domain>`**-desc.json**

The content of the source file is "compiled" to a set of intermediate
source files used to build the Jurism client. As context for the
comments below, please note the following:

1. Citations are generated from a set of
   [CSL-M](https://citeproc-js.readthedocs.io/en/latest/csl-m/index.html)
   variables.
2. Jurism uses an Abbrevs Filter plugin to map input variables to
   abbreviations as appropriate.
3. The Abbrevs Filter classifies variables into a set of categories
   to do its work, and the LRR supplies abbreviations to two of these:
   - The LRR key `abbrevs` sets abbreviations in the `institution-part`
     category; and
   - The LRR key `ABBREVS` sets abbreviations in the `institution-entire`
     category.
4. The `authority` variable is the CSL equivalent to the **Court**
   field in Jurism.

## `jurisupdate`: the LRR compiler

[forthcoming]

## Jurism output files and formats

The primary purpose of the Legal Resource Registry is to support the
storage and citation of legal materials in the Jurism reference
manager: it is part of that program's source code. National
jurisdictions and international organizations covered by the system
are each represented by a single source file containing its
identifiers and abbreviations, in a format that lends itself to manual
editing. The LRR source files are then "compiled" to produce two
intermediate source files, which are used in the actual Jurism build:
auto-abbreviation files; and user interface maps. The format of these
two targets is documented in this section.

### Abbreviations

#### Filename

The LRR compiler sets abbreviations for use in generating citations in
files named according to the following template:

* **auto-**`<domain>[`**-**`<variant>`**`]`.json**

* The *domain* is a two-character ISO country code (i.e. `us`, `jp`,
  etc.), or an ad hoc identifier for an international body
  (i.e. `eu.int`, `un.int`, `coe.int`).
* The optional *variant* element is an arbitrary name, which can
  be used to call the variant from a CSL style.
* Each supported jurisdiction *must* have a bare abbreviation file
  with no variant name. Multiple variants of a given jurisdiction
  are permitted.

#### File content


The file content itself is in JSON format. An annotated sample file is
below; there is quite a lot to digest here, and we will take it by
numbers. The full text of the sample can be found in [Appendix 2:
Sample abbreviation file](#appendix-2-sample-abbreviation-file).

> **Lines 2-4:** Three fields declare the `filename`, the `name` of the
> jurisdiction, and the `version` expressed as an ISO timestamp.[^3]

    "version": "2019-08-19 12:16:29 UTC",

> object.

```json-5
    "xdata": {
```

> **Line 6:** Each legal item in Jurism is assigned a `jurisdiction`
> value. Abbreviations are defined in the context of a specific
> jurisdiction, and the processor searches for a match within the item

[^3]: For performance reasons, the LRR compiler also sets the timestamp
      in a separate `DIRECTORY_LISTING.json` file in the abbreviations
      source directory.

### User Interface Maps

#### Filename

Jurisdiction and court codes are not exposed directly in the Jurism
user interface: a human-readable equivalent is displayed instead.  In
the Jurism source code, the data to produce maps for converting
between the two are stored in files named for the domain to which
each applies:

* **juris-**`<domain>`**-map.json**

A sample of such a file, illustrating a jurisdiction with multiple
languages, is shown below. The file format is quite compact to
minimize the bulk of data shipped with the Jurism client. There is
again a lot to unpack, and we will once more take it by line numbers.
The full text of this sample can be found in [Appendix 3:
Sample user interface map file](#appendix-3-sample-user-interface-map-file).

#### File content
