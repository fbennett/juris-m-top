## Jurisdiction identifiers

There is an important difference between the general principles of
citation in any comprehensive style guide, and the rules of citation
for legal materials.  The former describe patterns of citation
to be applied to all materials of a particular type. The patterns
themselves may vary. Consider how a journal article would appear in
a bibliography formatted in three common styles:

* **Chicago (note style)**<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gilmore, Grant. “Law, Logic and Experience.”
  *Howard Law Journal* 3 (1957): 26–41.

* **APA**<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gilmore, G. (1957). Law, Logic and Experience. *Howard
  Law Journal*, 3, 26–41.

* **Bluebook**<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grant Gilmore, Law, Logic and Experience, 3 <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Howard L.J.</span> 26 (1957).

In contrast, legal citations for a given jurisdiction will be roughly uniform
across all "parent" styles, but there is variation *among
jurisdictions*. For example, consider the following citations to court
judgments, all of which would be correct in any of the three styles above:

* **United States (Supreme
  Court)**<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;International Shoe
  Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310 (1945).

* **United Kingdom (House of
  Lords)**<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donoghue v. Stevenson, [1932]
  A.C. 562 (HL).

* **Germany (*Bundesgerichtshof*)**<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BGH IV ZR 241/18.

To cope with the confluence of format-by-style and
format-by-jurisdiction requirements, the "JM" styles in Jurism render
legal items by first calling a jurisdiction-specific style module to
obtain a set of "building-block" citation elements, and then
assembling them with markup and punctuation appropriate to the parent
style.[^1] In broad outline, the workflow looks like this:

[^1]: Final composition in the parent style gives it control over some
      style-specific features, such as the inclusion or stripping of periods,
      italicization of some titles, back-referencing conventions, and
      a few other details.


``` yaml
type: embedWideImage
src: ./2020-12-20-1/workflow.png
```

This scheme is made possible by a **Jurisdiction** field set on each
legal item. Jurism uses a machine-readable identifier set in this
field (discussed below) to select a *style module* appropriate to the
item.[^2]

>> One critical role of the LRR is to supply these essential jurisdiction identifiers,
>> and a human-readable name for each.

[^2]: The format of identifiers, described below, is inspired by Pier
      Luigi Spinosa, Enrico Francesconi, and Catarina Lupo, “[A
      Uniform Resource Name (URN) Namespace for Source of Law
      (LEX)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-spinosa-urn-lex/)”
      (IETF, expired work in progress, inactive, December 8, 2018).

## Court abbreviations

In citations to U.S. law, court abbreviations come in two flavors. One
is the form used to indicate the court when citing to a
multi-jurisdictional reporter. The abbreviated name in this case is an
amalgam that to the educated eye expresses both the court and its
jurisdiction:

* Lafond v. Sweeney, 343 P.3d 939 (<span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">Colo.</span> 2015).
* Begley v. Ireson, 399 P.3d 777 (<span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">Colo. Ct. App.</span> 2017).
* Pielet v. Pielet, 2012 <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">IL</span> 112064.
* McCarthy v. Pointer, 2013 <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">IL App (1st)</span> 121688.
* Fallini v. Hodel, 725 F. Supp. 1113 (<span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">D. Nev.</span> 1989).
* In Re Moore, 290 B.R. 287 (<span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">Bankr. E.D.N.C.</span> 2003).
* Edwards v. Ayers, 542 F.3d 759 (<span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">9th Cir.</span> 2008).

The second possible form is that used in a dozen or so
U.S. jurisdictions to indicate the court in a "vendor-neutral"
citation form:

* Lafond v. Sweeney, 2015 <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">CO</span> 3.
* Begley v. Ireson, 2017 <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">COA</span> 3.
* Pielet v. Pielet, 978 N.E.2d 1000 (<span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">Ill.</span> 2012).
* McCarthy v. Pointer, 3 N.E.3d 852 (<span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">Ill. App. Ct.</span> 2014).

To generate these various abbreviations, Jurism sets a
machine-readable code in the **Court** field, which is used together
with the jurisdiction code to look up the correct abbreviation for a
given citation.

>> A second critical role of the LRR is to supply a machine-readable
>> identifier for each court type and, for each
>> jurisdiction having a court of that type, to provide a human-readable
>> name and up to two abbreviations for use in that context.

## Reporters and abbreviations

To keep citations compact and clear, citation styles call for
abbreviations to be partially or completely suppressed in some
contexts, to avoid repetition. If a reporter is entirely dedicated
to decisions of a particular court, the court abbreviation is
omitted entirely:

* xxx

If a reporter is dedicated to decisions of a particular *jurisdiction*
by courts at more than one level, the jurisdiction hint can be removed
from the abbreviation, leaving only the court name:

* xxx

In one unusual case (Ohio), the abbreviation used in the
vendor-neutral citation form conveys only the jurisdiction. In this
case as well, the ordinary court abbreviation is included, with the
jurisdiction hint removed:

* xxx

Finally, it can happen that reporters require *additional* information
when cited, in a special citation form of their own. This is not a
feature of U.S. materials (as far as I know, as of this writing), but
it does appear in some jurisdictions. The following pair of citations
are to a judgment of the Austrian Constitutional Court
(*Verfassungsgerichtshof*):

* VfGH B 990/09, RdM 2010/61, 59 (Potacs)
* VfSlg 18.966/2009.

The citation forms are quite compact in this case, but these are
the elements...

| First example                                                                         || 
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| VfGH B 990/09 | Court abbreviation + docket number                                     |
| RdM 2010/61, 59 (Potacs)   | Journal abbreviation + year + volume + page + (commenter) |

| Second example                                                                        ||
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| VfSlg 18.966/2009 | Journal abbreviation + case ID + year                              |
