Whether you are a researcher, a lawyer, a journalist, or a student of
any subject, one part of your work involves the collection of
documents.  This brings with it persistent administrative burdens
associated with storing, organizing, retrieving, and correctly citing
materials that grow heavier over time.  Reference management is an
obvious and important application for computers, and software for this
purpose has existed for over forty-years, pre-dating word processors,
spreadsheets, web browsers, and the personal computer itself.

For reasons best known to history, legal research and multilingual
scholarship have been left behind in the long arc of reference manager
development. Jurism fills this gap in the research toolchest, with
full-lifecycle support for managing materials in multiple languages
and from multiple legal jurisdictions.

**Jurism** *is based on the popular open-source*
[Zotero](https://zotero.org) *reference manager. Like* Zotero *it is
free to install. For sharing materials among users or across multiple
machines,* Jurism *can sync libraries with*
[zotero.org](https://www.zotero.org/support/sync) *(free for unlimited
volumes of metadata, with subscription plans for file storage).  The
two projects are independent, however. If you wish to support* Jurism
*maintenance and development, please consider making a pledge to the
project on* [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/user?u=7258128).
