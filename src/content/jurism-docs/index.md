description: Jurism is based on Zotero, and most features work (or
             should work) exactly as in the “parent” project. The
             Zotero user base is very large, and the Zotero forums are
             an excellent source of information for troubleshooting.
             Note, however, that Jurism and Zotero are separate
             projects, and that Zotero team are not responsible
             for fielding Jurism support requests. When posting
             to the forums, please flag your post with **[Jurism]**
             in the subject line. Alternatively, post queries to
             the Jurism mailing lists.

             The Jurism manual covers only extended functionality not
             found in Zotero, and is currently a mix of user-facing
             tutorials and developer-facing documentation. New users
             will want to review the section on the Abbreviation
             Filter. Please note that the tutorials on multilingual
             styles may be significantly revised to reflect changes to
             some aspects of multi-locale styling.
