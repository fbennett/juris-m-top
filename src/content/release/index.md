title: Jurism Installers (Current Release)
description: The Jurism client is a desktop tool for managing
             research materials. Like other reference managers, it can
             be thought of as a “smart library” or “desktop research
             assistant” with support for collecting, organizing and
             citing resources.

             Jurism is based on the popular
             [Zotero](https://zotero.org) reference manager, to which
             it adds significant extensions to handle legal and
             multilingual resources.
