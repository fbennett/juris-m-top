description: The IndigoBook is a free and open statement of the
             “Bluebook” rules that are commonly applied to US legal
             resources.  The first (and current) edition is the
             creation Christopher Sprigman and a team of students at
             New York University, published by Carl Malamud at
             ``PublicResource.org``. Editorial work for a “2.0” update
             is being led by Jennifer Romig.
             
             The open-access, born-digital status of IndigoBook opens
             a path to integration of the guide with Jurism, to produce
             a fully automated citation system with an efficient
             and distributed editorial workflow, open to rolling feedback
             from the user community that relies on it.
