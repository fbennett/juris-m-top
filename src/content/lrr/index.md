title: Legal Resource Registry

description: The Legal Resource Registry contains an expanding
             collection of machine-readable mappings of legal
             jurisdictions and the courts that serve them. The
             repository contains scripts used to produce both the
             condensed maps that drive the **Jurisdiction** field of
             legal items in Jurism, and the jurisdiction-specific
             abbreviations used to produce correct legal citations.
