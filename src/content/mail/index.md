description: Register for the Jurism support list to receive project announcements
             and post support queries. The list is currently hosted on a Mailman server
             at the university where I work. Sometime in the next year or so
             (before I retire from the day job on April 1st 2022), I’ll be moving
             subscriptions, with member consent, to an external forum.
             
             As noted in the **Documentation: Jurism client** page,
             the Zotero forums are also a valuable source of information,
             but the Zotero developers cannot be expected to respond to
             queries related to Jurism.
