title: Jurism Mailing List

description: As of this writing (April 3, 2023), I have been absent from the
             the Jurism mailing lists for quite some time. I will be working
             through the substantial backlog in the coming weeks and months,
             but I can't guarantee a quick response to new posts there.
             
             The project also has an active Discord server, for quicker
             responses to simple questions.
             
             As noted in the **Documentation:Â Jurism client** page,
             the Zotero forums are also a valuable source of information,
             but do note that the Zotero developers cannot be expected to respond to
             queries specific to Jurism.
