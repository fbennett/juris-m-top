title: CSL-M Documentation

description: CSL-M is an extended version of CSL (“Citation Style Language”),
             a stylesheet grammar recognized by Zotero and other popular bibliographic
             tools. Mainstream CSL documentation applies equally to CSL-M styles; the two
             sets of documentation should be read together.

             In Jurism, the CSL-M stylesheet language works together
             with a modular approach to jurisdiction-specific styling
             (not yet documented here) to support legal citation
             styles for a range of jurisdictions within a single
             document or bibliography.
             
             In many applications, no special adjustments to a CSL or CSL-M style
             are needed to support multilingual references, as translations
             and transliterations can be inserted into citations automatically
             by the citation processor.
